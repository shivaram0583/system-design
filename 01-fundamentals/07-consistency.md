## A. Concept Explanation

### What is Consistency?

**Consistency** means that all nodes/replicas in a distributed system see the **same data at the same time**. After a write completes, every subsequent read should return that written value.

```
CONSISTENT (ideal):
  Client writes X = 5
  Server A: X = 5  ✓
  Server B: X = 5  ✓  ← All servers agree immediately
  Server C: X = 5  ✓

INCONSISTENT (reality in distributed systems):
  Client writes X = 5 to Server A
  Server A: X = 5  ✓
  Server B: X = 3  ✗  ← Still has old value (replication lag)
  Server C: X = 3  ✗
  
  → Eventually B and C catch up, but there's a window
    where clients see different values depending on
    which server they hit.
```

### Consistency Models — From Strongest to Weakest

| Model | Guarantee | Performance | Use Case |
|-------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Linearizability** | Every read sees the most recent write globally | Slowest | Distributed locks, leader election |
| **Sequential Consistency** | Operations appear in some total order consistent with each client's order | Slow | Bank transactions |
| **Causal Consistency** | Causally related ops appear in order; concurrent ops may differ | Moderate | Social media (reply after post) |
| **Read-Your-Writes** | You always see your own writes | Moderate | User profile updates |
| **Monotonic Reads** | You never see older data after seeing newer data | Fast | Dashboard displays |
| **Eventual Consistency** | All replicas converge eventually (no time guarantee) | Fastest | DNS, social media likes, CDN |

### Strong Consistency

Every read returns the most recent write. The system behaves as if there's only one copy of the data.

### Eventual Consistency

After a write, replicas will **eventually** converge to the same value, but reads during the replication window may return stale data.

### Consistency vs Availability Trade-off

![Consistency vs Availability Trade-off diagram](../assets/generated/01-fundamentals-07-consistency-diagram-03.svg)

### Read-Your-Writes Consistency

A weaker but practical model: you always see your own writes, even if other users might see stale data.

```
Read-Your-Writes:

  User A writes profile name = "Alice"
  User A reads profile → sees "Alice" ✓ (always)
  User B reads profile → might see old name briefly ✗ (OK for many apps)

Implementation strategies:
  1. Route user's reads to the same replica they wrote to
  2. Track write timestamp; if read replica is behind, read from primary
  3. Client-side: cache recent writes, merge with server response
```

### Monotonic Reads

Once you've seen a value, you'll never see an older value on subsequent reads.

```
WITHOUT monotonic reads:
  Read 1 → Server A → X = 5 (latest)
  Read 2 → Server B → X = 3 (older!)   ← Confusing to user!

WITH monotonic reads:
  Read 1 → Server A → X = 5
  Read 2 → Server A → X = 5 (or newer) ← Always same or newer
  
  Implementation: Sticky sessions (route user to same replica)
                  OR: Track read version, reject stale replicas
```

### Quorum Reads and Writes

A practical approach to tunable consistency:

### Conflict Resolution in Eventual Consistency

When two replicas have different values, who wins?

| Strategy | How | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-----|------|------|
| **Last-Write-Wins (LWW)** | Higher timestamp wins | Simple | Data loss if clocks diverge |
| **Vector Clocks** | Track causal history per replica | No data loss | Complex, growing metadata |
| **CRDTs** | Conflict-free data structures | Auto-merge, no coordination | Limited data types |
| **Application-level** | App decides (e.g., merge carts) | Domain-specific logic | More code complexity |

## B. Interview View

### What Interviewers Expect

| Level | Expectation |
|-------|------------|
| **Junior** | Knows strong vs eventual consistency |
| **Mid** | Can choose consistency model for a given use case; knows quorum |
| **Senior** | Discusses trade-offs with availability; knows multiple consistency models |
| **Staff+** | Designs tunable consistency; discusses CRDTs, vector clocks, conflict resolution |

### Red Flags

- Saying "always use strong consistency"
- Not knowing eventual consistency exists or when to use it
- Confusing consistency (data) with consistency in ACID (database constraints)
- Not considering the CAP theorem implications
- Ignoring replication lag in their design

### Common Follow-up Questions

1. "What consistency model would you use for this system?"
2. "What happens if two users update the same record simultaneously?"
3. "How do you handle stale reads from a replica?"
4. "What is a quorum and how does it help?"
5. "When is eventual consistency acceptable?"
6. "How would you implement read-your-writes consistency?"

## C. Practical Engineering View

### Consistency in Real Databases

| Database | Default Consistency | Tunable? |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **PostgreSQL** | Strong (single node) | Read replicas = eventual |
| **MySQL** | Strong (single node) | Semi-sync replicas available |
| **MongoDB** | Eventual (by default) | Yes: write concern, read concern |
| **Cassandra** | Eventual (by default) | Yes: consistency level per query |
| **DynamoDB** | Eventual (by default) | Strong reads available (2× cost) |
| **Redis** | Eventual (async replication) | WAIT command for sync |
| **CockroachDB** | Strong (serializable) | Not tunable (always strong) |
| **Spanner** | Strong (external consistency) | Not tunable (always strong) |

### Practical Consistency Choices

```
Banking / Payments:
  → Strong consistency (can't show wrong balance)
  → Use: Single primary DB, synchronous replication
  → Sacrifice: Latency (writes wait for replicas)

Social Media Feed:
  → Eventual consistency (OK if post appears 2s late)
  → Use: Async replication, CDN caching
  → Benefit: Low latency, high availability

E-Commerce Inventory:
  → Strong for purchase (can't oversell)
  → Eventual for display (show "~50 left" is fine)
  → Use: Strong writes to primary, read from cache/replica

User Profile:
  → Read-your-writes (see your own changes instantly)
  → Eventual for other viewers
  → Use: Sticky sessions or client-side merge
```

### Monitoring Replication Lag

```
Key metrics to track:
  • Replication lag (seconds behind primary)
  • Replica lag bytes (bytes of WAL not yet applied)
  • Read consistency violations (client reports stale data)

Alert thresholds:
  < 1s:   Normal (most apps tolerate this)
  1-5s:   Warning (may affect user experience)
  5-30s:  Critical (stale data becoming noticeable)
  > 30s:  Emergency (replica may be broken)

PostgreSQL: SELECT pg_last_wal_replay_lsn() - pg_last_wal_receive_lsn();
MySQL:      SHOW SLAVE STATUS → Seconds_Behind_Master
Cassandra:  nodetool repair status
```

## D. Example: Shopping Cart — Choosing Consistency

### Scenario

E-commerce shopping cart with 10M users, multi-region deployment.

### Option 1: Strong Consistency

```
User adds item to cart → Write to primary DB → Sync replicate → ACK
  Latency: 150ms (cross-region replication)
  If primary is in US and user is in EU: 300ms round trip
  If primary is down: Cart is unavailable ✗

Pros: Cart is always accurate
Cons: Slow for global users, availability issues
```

### Option 2: Eventual Consistency with Conflict Resolution

```
User adds item to cart → Write to LOCAL replica → ACK → Async replicate
  Latency: 5ms (local write)
  If other region is down: Cart still works ✓

Conflict scenario:
  User opens cart on phone: cart = [A, B]
  User opens cart on laptop: cart = [A, B]
  Phone adds item C: cart = [A, B, C]
  Laptop adds item D: cart = [A, B, D]
  → Conflict! Two versions exist

Resolution (CRDT - Add-Wins Set):
  Merge: cart = [A, B, C, D]  ← Union of both
  User sees all items they added. No data loss.
```

## E. HLD and LLD

### E.1 HLD — Multi-Region Consistent Key-Value Store

#### Requirements

- Support GET, PUT, DELETE
- Tunable consistency (strong or eventual per request)
- 3 regions, 99.99% availability
- 100K reads/sec, 10K writes/sec

#### Architecture

![Architecture diagram](../assets/generated/01-fundamentals-07-consistency-diagram-06.svg)

#### Trade-offs

| Decision | Chosen | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Quorum-based | Yes | Tunable consistency without full replication wait |
| 3 replicas | Balances durability and cost | 5 is more durable but expensive |
| Async replication for eventual | Yes | Sub-ms latency for non-critical reads |

### E.2 LLD — Consistency Manager

#### Pseudocode

```java
public class ConsistencyManager {
    private final List<Replica> replicas;
    private final int quorum; // Typically ceil(N/2) + 1

    public ConsistencyManager(List<Replica> replicas, int quorumSize) {
        this.replicas = replicas; this.quorum = quorumSize;
    }

    public Object read(String key, String level) {
        switch (level) {
            case "STRONG":   return quorumRead(key);
            case "EVENTUAL": return singleRead(key);
            case "LOCAL":    return localRead(key);
            default: throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown level: " + level);
        }
    }

    public boolean write(String key, Object value, String level) {
        Map<String, Object> versioned = Map.of(
            "value", value, "timestamp", System.currentTimeMillis(),
            "version", UUID.randomUUID().toString());
        return "STRONG".equals(level) ? quorumWrite(key, versioned)
                                      : asyncWrite(key, versioned);
    }

    /** Read from quorum replicas, return latest version */
    private Object quorumRead(String key) {
        List<Map<String, Object>> responses = parallelCall(
            replicas, r -> r.get(key), quorum, 100);
        Map<String, Object> latest = responses.stream()
            .max(Comparator.comparingLong(r -> (long) r.get("timestamp")))
            .orElseThrow();
        // Read-repair: update stale replicas
        for (Map<String, Object> r : responses)
            if (!r.get("version").equals(latest.get("version")))
                asyncRepair(r, key, latest);
        return latest.get("value");
    }

    /** Write to quorum replicas, wait for confirmation */
    private boolean quorumWrite(String key, Map<String, Object> versioned) {
        List<Boolean> acks = parallelCall(
            replicas, r -> r.put(key, versioned), quorum, 200);
        return acks.size() >= quorum;
    }

    /** Read from any one replica (fastest) */
    private Object singleRead(String key) {
        Replica replica = pickFastestReplica();
        return replica.get(key).get("value");
    }

    /** Write to one replica, async replicate to others */
    private boolean asyncWrite(String key, Map<String, Object> versioned) {
        Replica primary = pickPrimary(key);
        primary.put(key, versioned);
        for (Replica r : replicas)
            if (r != primary) asyncReplicate(r, key, versioned);
        return true;
    }
}
```

#### Edge Cases

| Edge Case | Handling |
|-----------|---------|
| Quorum unreachable (2 of 3 down) | Return error for strong reads; serve stale for eventual |
| Clock skew between replicas | Use hybrid logical clocks (HLC) instead of wall clock |
| Write conflicts (concurrent writes) | LWW with vector clocks; or CRDT merge |
| Read-repair fails | Retry in background; track repair debt metric |
| Network partition between regions | Each region serves local; merge on heal |

## F. Summary & Practice

### Key Takeaways

1. **Consistency** = all nodes see the same data at the same time
2. **Strong consistency**: correct but slow; **eventual consistency**: fast but temporarily stale
3. The consistency model should match the **business requirement**, not be one-size-fits-all
4. **Quorum** (W + R > N) gives tunable consistency without waiting for all replicas
5. **Read-your-writes** is often sufficient and much cheaper than full strong consistency
6. **Conflict resolution** strategies: LWW, vector clocks, CRDTs, application-level merge
7. **Replication lag** is the root cause of inconsistency — monitor it
8. **Banking needs strong consistency**; social media can use eventual; many apps use a mix
9. CAP theorem forces a choice between consistency and availability during partitions
10. **Read-repair** and **anti-entropy** help bring stale replicas back in sync

### Revision Checklist

### Interview Questions

1. What is consistency in distributed systems?
2. Compare strong and eventual consistency with examples.
3. What is a quorum? How does W + R > N guarantee consistency?
4. When is eventual consistency acceptable?
5. How would you handle a shopping cart with eventual consistency?
6. What are CRDTs and when would you use them?

### Practice Exercises

1. **Exercise 1**: For N=5 replicas, list all valid (W, R) combinations that guarantee strong consistency. Which gives the best read performance? Best write performance?

2. **Exercise 2**: Design a shopping cart using eventual consistency with CRDT-based conflict resolution. Show what happens when two devices add different items simultaneously.

3. **Exercise 3**: Your replica lag is 5 seconds. A user updates their profile and immediately refreshes. They see the old data. Design 3 different solutions to give them read-your-writes consistency.

4. **Exercise 4**: You have a social media app where comments must appear in order (causal consistency) but likes can be eventually consistent. Design the data flow for each.
